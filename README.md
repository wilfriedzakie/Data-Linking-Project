# Data-Linking-Project


The semantic Web have huge amount of data available in a standard format,
reachable and manageable by using semantic Web tools.


In order to browse data over the Web, machines should be able to resolve the
multiplicity of data references related to the same real world object, by defining
correspondences among data in form of data links.


In general terms, data linking is the task of determining whether two objects
descriptions refer to the same object.


This task is performed on the basis of evaluating the degree of similarity among
different data instances. The higher is the similarity between two data descriptions, the
higher is the probability that these descriptions actually refer to the same object.


This project presents an implementation and instructional information that
describe the approach to match entities from two ontologies i.e Data Linking.
